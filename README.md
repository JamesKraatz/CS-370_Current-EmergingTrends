* Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: 
In this assignment, I applied concepts of neural networks, reinforcement learning, and Q-algorithms to design code for a pathfinding intelligent agent. 

	* What code were you given? 
I was provided started code and a sample environment.

	* What code did you create yourself?
My contribution was code to train the pirate agent to successfully navigate the environment.

* Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
In addition to exposure to AI and ML, this course has also taught me how to utilize frameworks more successfully.

	* What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists look for programmatic solutions to problems.

	* How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
My typical approach to problem is to try and fully identify the problem and determine what is the intended goal of the solution. Secondly, I attempt to develop a specification or criteria of the solution and after this, I work on exploring as many possible solutions as I can and to assess which possible solution may be effective. Constant reference has to be made back to the problem and the goal of the solution, “the specification,” to ensure the chosen solution is still correct and the development is still on course. 

	* What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities to the end-user and organization start with trust, honesty, and integrity. All three of these go hand in hand and are necessary for sustained business. The employer needs to trust that the employee will honestly work for the client’s interest through the employer with integrity. Some examples are maintaining trades secrets and protected IP, not deceiving the company or client by trying to hide defective product, and not misrepresenting yourself or the product on behalf of the company or client.
